    Usage:
      Simply load this script on any offending webpage (most of them)
      and watch your troubles disappear. Ah, now you can actually read
      the damned thing.
  
    What:
      Detox is a very, very simple script that crawls a page for
      <link rel="stylesheet">, <style> and <script> tags and removes
      their contents, thus removing much of what makes the web awful.
