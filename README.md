  Usage:
    Simply load this script on any offending webpage (most of them)
    and watch your troubles disappear. Ah, now you can actually read
    the damned thing.

  What:
    Detox is a very, very simple script that crawls a page for
    <link rel="stylesheet">, <style> and <script> tags and removes
    their contents, thus removing much of what makes the web awful.
